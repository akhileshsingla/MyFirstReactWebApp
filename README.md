My first reactJS web-app. 

This web-app is made using the following YouTube reactJS crash course tutorial:

For hosting it on gh-pages I followed the below link:

The web-app is a basic ToDo task list. It isn't connected by a backend or a fake backend so if you refresh the page it will go back to its original state of 3 todo tasks. Thus, it won't save your Todo tasks after a refresh.
